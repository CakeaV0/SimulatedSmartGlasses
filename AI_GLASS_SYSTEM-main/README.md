### Smart Glasses and Mobile Applications for the Blind People 

#### Introduction
The smart glasses for the blind are an innovative device powered by artificial intelligence, designed to assist visually impaired individuals in interacting with their surroundings. To complement the glasses, a set of mobile applications provides similar features, offering an alternative solution for those who may not have access to the glasses.

#### How It Works
The smart glasses capture images through an integrated camera based on voice commands from the user. The images are sent to a server built using "Flask" for processing and analysis by artificial intelligence models. The results are then transmitted back to the glasses and presented to the user through a built-in speaker.

Similarly, the mobile applications replicate all the features of the glasses, allowing users to access these functionalities directly from their smartphones. This ensures that users who cannot afford the glasses can still benefit from the technology.

#### Key Features

**Smart Glasses:**
1. **Object Detection**: Identifying objects in the surrounding environment.
2. **Currency Recognition**: Recognizing and counting Egyptian currency, determining its total value.
3. **Object Search**: Searching for specific objects by name and determining their locations.
4. **Person Recognition**: Recognizing individuals and saving faces for future reference.
5. **Scene Description**: Providing a detailed description of the scene in front of the user.
6. **Text Reading and Translation**: Reading, translating, and summarizing Arabic and English texts.
7. **AI Assistant**: Helping users understand the system, learn how each feature works, and answer questions.

**Mobile Applications:**
1. **All Features of the Glasses**: Providing the same functionalities as the smart glasses for users who use smartphones instead.
2. **Parent Control**: Allowing guardians to monitor and assist the blind person by tracking their location and accessing the camera to provide support.

#### Future Enhancements
Future developments could include:
1. **Expanded Language Support**: Supporting more languages in both glasses and mobile applications.
2. **Improved Battery Life**: Enhancing the efficiency of both devices.
3. **Augmented Reality Integration**: Adding AR features for a richer user experience.
4. **Enhanced Connectivity**: Better integration with smart devices and IoT ecosystems.
5. **Advanced Customization**: Allowing more personalized settings for both glasses and apps.

#### Impact and Social Contribution
This project aims to make a significant social impact by:
- **Promoting Inclusivity**: Helping visually impaired individuals participate more fully in various activities.
- **Increasing Independence**: Empowering users with tools for greater self-reliance.
- **Enhancing Safety**: Providing real-time environmental information to prevent accidents.

#### Conclusion
The smart glasses and accompanying mobile applications for the blind demonstrate the potential of technology to create positive changes in people's lives. By offering a versatile solution through both glasses and apps, this project ensures that visually impaired individuals have the tools they need to lead independent, fulfilling, and safe lives. The AI Assistant and parent control features further enhance the usability and support provided, making the technology more accessible and beneficial.
